# smart-pi-on-edge
deploying a raspberryPi on azure iot hub as an edge device

This project aims to explore the implementation of Pervasive Computing in the context of Internet of Things (IoT). Pervasive Computing refers to the integration of smart devices and technologies into our everyday surroundings, enabling seamless connectivity and intelligent interactions. By combining the power of ESP8266 with sensors, Raspberry Pi as edge device with multiple modules, and Azure Cloud services, this project creates a scalable IoT system.
